- splashscreen is the scene that needs to be run from the editor to get the full effect of the game

- we had a lot of issues transferring this project from one person to another. Model files weren't working for the enemies
with imported models, mismatched version errors even though we were using the same version, object creation errors, and others
so it there might be some issues.

- The powerups arent labelled well so:
each area a coin spawns theres a 1/10 chance a powerup will spawn
green + 	-> +2 health
red pill 	-> invisibility 
blue pill 	-> laser beams
yellow pill	-> speed boost
purple pill	-> teleport (stacks up to 5 times) (we didnt make an indicator for how many teleports you get)
